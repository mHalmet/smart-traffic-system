# Smart Traffic System (Work in progress)

This repository contains the work related to my masters thesis for the Data Science Masters Program at TU Wien

# The project is built on the work created by Andrea Vidali on Deep Q-Learning controlled Traffic lights
https://github.com/AndreaVidali/Deep-QLearning-Agent-for-Traffic-Signal-Control

# The goal is to extend this concept to a multi-agent collaborative system which is scalable to large traffic grids
